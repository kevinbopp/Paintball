# Paintball!
Small 2D multiplayer shooting game (same-screen only). For the sake of saving space, audioFiles and Resources folders have been omitted from this repo. This serves as an archive of my **code** only, NOT the built game.

To download the built, playable project, retrieve it it from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gxIG5pHwe1gFivzdAp1LtBYRyC20-Q17/view?usp=sharing).
Alternatively, it is available on my website for download at [kevincbopp.com](https://www.kevincbopp.com).
